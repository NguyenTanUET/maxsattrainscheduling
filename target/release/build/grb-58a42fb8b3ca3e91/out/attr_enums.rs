The MIP solver will attempt to build an initial solution from this vector when it is\navailable.

One possibility is that your MIP start is infeasible. Another, more common possibility is that\none of the Gurobi heuristics found a solution that is as good as the solution produced by the MIP start, so the MIP\nstart solution was cut off. Finally, if you specified a partial MIP start, it is possible that the limited MIP\nexploration done on this partial start was insufficient to find a new incumbent solution. You can try setting the\nStartNodeLimit parameter to a larger value if you want Gurobi to work harder to try to complete the partial start.\n\nIf you solve a sequence of models, where one is built by modifying the previous one, and if you don't provide a MIP\nstart, then Gurobi will try to construct one automatically from the solution of the previous model. If you don't want it\nto try this, you should reset the model before starting the subsequent solve. If you provided a MIP start but would\nprefer to use the previous solution as the start instead, you should clear your start (by setting the `Start` attribute\nto undefined for all variables).\n\nIf you have multiple start vectors, you can provide them to Gurobi by using the `Start` attribute in combination with\nthe `NumStart` attribute and the StartNumber parameter. Specifically, use the `NumStart` attribute to indicate how many\nstart vectors you will supply. Then set the StartNumber parameter to a value between 0 and NumStart-1 to indicate which\nstart you are supplying. For each value of StartNumber, populate the `Start` attribute to supply that start. Gurobi will\nuse all of the provided starts. As an alternative, you can append new MIP start vectors to your model by setting the\nStartNumber parameter to -1. In this case, whenever you read a MIP start, or use a function to set a MIP start value for\na set of variables, a new MIP start will be created, the parameter `NumStart` will be increased, and any unspecified\nvariable will be left as undefined.\n\nIf you want to diagnose an infeasible MIP start, you can try fixing the variables in the model to their values in your\nMIP start (by setting their lower and upper bound attributes). If the resulting MIP model is infeasible, you can then\ncompute an IIS on this model to get additional information that should help to identify the cause of the infeasibility.\n\nOnly affects MIP models.\n\n[Reference manual](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/start.html).\n"] Start , # [doc = "- __Modifiable:__ Yes\n- __Type:__ double (`f64`)\n\n\nVariable upper bound.

If you know that a variable is likely to take a particular value in high quality solutions of a MIP\nmodel, you can provide that value as a hint. You can also (optionally) provide information about your level of\nconfidence in a hint with the `VarHintPri` attribute.\n\nThe Gurobi MIP solver will use these variable hints in a number of different ways. Hints will affect the heuristics that\nGurobi uses to find feasible solutions, and the branching decisions that Gurobi makes to explore the MIP search tree. In\ngeneral, high quality hints should produce high quality MIP solutions faster. In contrast, low quality hints will lead\nto some wasted effort, but shouldn't lead to dramatic performance degradations.\n\nVariables hints and MIP starts are similar in concept, but they behave in very different ways. If you specify a MIP\nstart, the Gurobi MIP solver will try to build a single feasible solution from the provided set of variable values. If\nyou know a solution, you should use a MIP start to provide it to the solver. In contrast, variable hints provide\nguidance to the MIP solver that affects the entire solution process. If you have a general sense of the likely values\nfor variables, you should provide them through variable hints.\n\nIf you wish to leave the hint value for a variable undefined, you can either avoid setting the `VarHintVal` attribute\nfor that variable, or you can set it to a special undefined value (GRB_UNDEFINED in C and C++, GRB.UNDEFINED in Java,\n.NET, and Python, NA in R or nan in Matlab).\n\nNote that deleting variables from your model will cause several attributes to be discarded (variable hints and branch\npriorities).
